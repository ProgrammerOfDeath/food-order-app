# Simple Food Order APP with React

During a Udemy React course, the task was to build an ordering app. I used this task and extended it a bit and built my own design.

I am actually a Vue developer and wanted to explore React with the course. 

During the assignment I learned how to use different React hooks, portals, refs and the context API.
